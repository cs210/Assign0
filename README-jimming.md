# Jimming He

## Introduction

Hello team! I'm Jimming, a Computer Science major at Stanford, specializing in AI. I'm excited to bring my skills and experiences to our collaborative endeavors! I'm interested in AI/ML applications, AR technologies, and startups.

## Industry Experience

- **Cleanlab, San Francisco, CA**
  - Machine Learning Engineer Intern
- **Coursera, Mountain View, CA**
  - Software Engineer Intern, Payments
- **Meta (formerly Facebook), Menlo Park, CA**
  - Software Engineer Intern, Facebook News Feed
- **Airforce Research Laboratory (Remote)**
  - Machine Learning Research Intern, Sensor Translation

## Projects

1. **Discord Content Moderation and CSAM Detection Bot**
   - Implemented manual user reporting and moderator review flows using Discordâ€™s API. Implemented automatic CSAM removal by training a ResNet50 CNN model on 9000+ self-labeled images,
2. **Deep Learning for Music Generation**
   - Worked with CNN, RNN, and LSTM models to generate modern and impressionist-sounding music.
3. **Solving Blackjack with Reinforcement Learning**
   - Simulated the game of Blackjack as a MDP and implemented value iteration, Q-learning, and SARSA algorithms to determine an optimal strategy.
4. **3D U-Net Architectures for Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation**
   - Built U-Net models and trained them on multimodal MRI scans to produce segmentation labels of the glioma sub-regions.

## Skills
