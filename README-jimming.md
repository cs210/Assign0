  - Machine Learning Engineer Intern
- **Coursera**
  - Software Engineer Intern, Payments Platform
- **Meta**
  - Software Engineer Intern, Facebook News Feed
- **Airforce Research Laboratory**
  - Machine Learning Research Intern, Sensor Translation

## Course Projects

1. **CS152: Discord Content Moderation and CSAM Detection Bot**
   - Implemented manual user reporting and moderator review flows using Discordâ€™s API. Implemented automatic CSAM removal by training a ResNet50 CNN model on 9000+ self-labeled images,
2. **CS229: Deep Learning for Music Generation**
   - Worked with CNN, RNN, and LSTM models to generate modern and impressionist-sounding music.
3. **CS238: Solving Blackjack with Reinforcement Learning**
   - Simulated the game of Blackjack as a MDP and implemented value iteration, Q-learning, and SARSA algorithms to determine an optimal strategy.
4. **CS231N: 3D U-Net Architectures for Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation**
   - Built U-Net models and trained them on multimodal MRI scans to produce segmentation labels of the glioma sub-regions.

## Skills
