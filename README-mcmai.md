# Minh Chau (Jenny) Mai ðŸ‘‹

Hi friends! My name is Jenny Mai and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science on the AI track (and a bit of Psychology). I enjoy creating affective AI/ML projects that evoke human emotion from users (happiness, anger, etc.).

## Technical Skills
- Python, C++, Javascript/HTML/CSS, SQL (MySQL, NoSQL)
- Pytorch, Scikit, NumPy, Pandas, Hugging Face, NodeJS, MongoDB
- AWS, Linux/Unix, Git/Github, Jupyter, Colab

## Fun Projects

One of the projects I was involved in under the Stanford HCI group was a mock social media feed to display ranked political content, measuring the polarization between users of various political leanings (aka making people angry over politics!). This project was implemented with Flask, JavaScript, and MongoDB and required real-time API calls to OpenAI as to rank the "tweets". The overall findings resulted acceptance into CSCW '24 and future publication in PACM HCI!

## Fun Facts
- I spend too much money finding new places to eat or to get dessert.
- I have a betta fish named Fred and a ivory mystery snail named Sheldon (don't tell R&DE).
- I taught myself guitar for 6 years, but still haven't memorized the guitar strings. 
- I've had my car keys stolen by a goose. 
- Like I said before, [I like to evoke people's emotions](http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ "are you sure about this?").
