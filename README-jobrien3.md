### Hey everyone! My name is Joey O'Brien, and I am currently a senior here at Stanford studying CS with a concentration in systems (I am also co-terming in AI and have dived pretty deep into these classes as well). 
### Here are a few different pieces of information about me:
#
## Projects/Work Experience

* I am a co-author of [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586183.3606763) which won a best paper award at [UIST](https://uist.acm.org/2023/). To boil down the main concept, we essentially used an LLM to creat NPCs that dynmically engaged with one another, had "personalities" that influenced their actions, and had memory of their previous actions (i.e. they were not pre-scripted). The paper was later dicussed in media such as [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02818-9) and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-avatars-let-loose-in-virtual-town-display-beginnings-agi-2023-4).
* I am currently finishing up an [open-source project](https://github.com/sisl/wildfire) with Joseph Guman and Christopher Pondoc (both also in CS210) in conjucntion with the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory](https://sisl.stanford.edu/)(SISL) where we are creating a reinforcement learning environment for wildfire evacuation. 
* I had a [workshop paper](https://icml.cc/virtual/2023/28930) at [ICML](https://icml.cc/) last summer (also with Joseph and Christopher) that centered around identifying real images from diffusion-model generated images. This project originally stemmed from CS229 (where it won a best project award), so it was pretty cool to pursue it further. 

* Last Summer, I interned for the autonomous vehicle company [Motional](https://motional.com/) (a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv) as a part of the Advanced Projects team. 

## Some Technical Skills
Python, Pytorch, C, C++, CUDA

## Other Information
* I grew up in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts and am a huge fan of New England sports teams. 
* I am a member of the men's rowing team on campus. 
* I'm excited for CS210 this quarter!
