## Intro

My name is Leon, I'm an international student from Sydney, Australia. I am coterming in CS (HCI) and was on the Varsity Swim Team as an undergrad here. I like video games, bodysurfing and fishing. I love project work: the ideation process, iterative prototyping and front end design (UI/UX) are my strongsuits.

## Technical Skills

I have completed the CS core at Stanford, along with classes in the HCI track. Therefore I am experienced with python, C++, C, React Native and Figma. I'm also very experienced with SQL and have used Google BigQuery.

I was an Econ major as an undergrad, and therefore I am very familiar with market dynamics, auctions, game theory and behavioural economics.

## Soft Skills

I have great leadership and communication skills. I was Captain of the Stanford Swim Team my Senior Year and have much experience with client-facing roles through my internship experience. I am very accustomed to managing group work and maintaining a fun positive environment even during times of high-stress. I'm also very disciplined when it comes to time management due to my chaotic schedule as a Student-Athlete. Consequently, I typically like to start early on actionable items and always aim to finish things 1-2 days before a deadline.

## Experience

I've worked at Fintech startup (Zanbato), the Stanford Endowment Fund and a Growth Equity Firm in NYC (Long Ridge Equity Partners). All of which have given me an enriched perspective on the startup ecosystem ranging from companies themselves to early-stage investors and the limited partners that fund VCs. Therefore I believe I'd be very effective at communicating with VCs and pitching a company if the project launches.

Zanbato (fintech startup) created an online trading platform (ZX) for private stock geared towards broker dealers. During my time as an intern there I assisted in adding a new feature to the platform - the visualisation of share prices for stock traded on ZX using mutufal fund data, 409A evals, ZX buy/sell prices etc. Here I learned how projects work within a corporate environment, from ideation, to implementation, testing and optimization. Just so, I believe my experience at Zanbato will help me be a very effective teammate in CS210.

Long Ridge is a $2B growth stage private equity firm specialized in Fintech investing. Here I learned the ins and outs of what early stage investors typically look for within startups and companies that are approaching profitability. Moreover I conducted extremely thorough market research into areas such as payments, cybersecurity and healthcare revenue cycle management. Therefore for this project, I will have strong skills in assessing the competitive landscape within a certain industry, pitching to VCs and also have a rich network of industry experts I could contact due to my ties to this company.
