# Mahathi Mangipudi

## Introduction
Hi everyone! My name is Mahathi and I'm a senior majoring in CS on the AI track and minoring in sustainability. I'm really passionate about the applications of AI and computational methods to addressing pressing environmental issues. 

** Technical Skills: ** Python, C++/C, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Scikit-learn, Git, Firebase

## Past Projects
** Computer Vision Pipeline to Classify Fashion Aesthetic of Outfits **
Finetuned ResNet-32 CNN with label smoothing on 300,000 annotated images to extract outfit features. Trained SVM, logistic regression, and random forest classifiers on labels and GLCM features and analyzed ablations. 

** Quantifying the Emotional Value of Poetry via Sound Symbolism **
Built database of 300+ processed poems and statistically confirmed relationship between plosive phonemes and emotion. Coded Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression Model in Python, predicted emotion to 86% accuracy. 

** Perceptive Positivity Pals **
Built online journalling system with features to sort and store notes using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Firebase. 

## Experience
** eDNA Explorer **
Deployed ML-driven climate tools for environmental health management to 272 contributors across 47 projects. Specifically worked to help highlight vulnerable, invasive, and pathogenic species found at research sites based on eDNA samples. 

** Logic Finder **
I restored an offline server, troubleshooting LAN, Cisco switches, and VPNs, improving productivity by 50%. Also collaborated with off-shore team, optimized anomaly-detection ML models to handle larger data sets in Python. 

** IsoLab, University of Washington **
Applied computational techniques in Python to study historical megaflood erosion in the Himalayas. Helped publish a paper in the Journal for Geophysical Research - Earth Surface (AGU) in 2022.
