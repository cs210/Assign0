# About Me

Hi! I'm a machine learning enthusiast with a strong foundation in software engineering and a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and graph-based models, with hands-on experience in designing and deploying ML solutions. I also have good experience in full-stack web app engineering and UI/UX design. Additionally, I've acquired some product management knowledge through course and personal endeavors. I'd consider myself to be an independently motivated learner who deeply values communication, documentation, and collaboration skills.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about current events, learning about history, and taking walks/hikes. Occasionally, I ice skate, practice golf, and watch k-dramas.

### Technical Background

I’m proficient in Python, C++, and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, with familiaraity in Java, JavaScript and shell scripting. My experience includes working with ML models like transformers, diffusion models, and GNNs, and applying them to domains like recommendation systems, generative AI, and multimodal data analysis.

### Professional Experience

I’ve had the privilege of contributing to some exciting projects:

- At a stealth startup, I built a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that enhanced product descriptions for 2nd-hand fashion listings.
- As part of SAIL, I co-developed **GenieWizard**, an AI-driven tool to simplify app testing and feature development, significantly improving developer productivity.
- At Hebbia AI (Series-B, a16z backed), I engineered multimodal CV-NLP models for complex document analysis, fine-tuning BERT to handle unstructured data.

### Project Highlights

Some of the projects I’m most proud of include:

- **A Course Recommendation System**: Co-implemented a graph-based ML model that personalzes course recommendations for OnCourse users (oncourse.college, 5000+ users).
- **Generative Diffusion Models**: Explored the impact of self-attention in image generation, achieving measurable improvements in quality and diversity.
- **COVID-19 Detection**: Developed a CNN-LSTM model that leveraged cough audio data, outperforming baseline classifiers.

### Beyond Work

I enjoy diving into challenging problems, whether it’s refining ML algorithms or developing new tools to streamline workflows. Outside of tech, I’m fluent in both English and Mandarin and love exploring new ways to connect with people and ideas.
