## Arjun Sharma: About Me 👤
Hello, my name is Arjun. I'm a 4th year CS co-term (AI / HCI) 🎓. I'm passionate about all things related to EdTech, but I am also interested in creating projects in areas like healthcare 🏥 and finance 💼! I'm experienced in mobile app development 📱 and working with LLMs. I'm looking forward to seeing the cool things everyone makes! 🚀

## Project Highlights 🌟
- **Software Engineer | Stanford HCI Lab | June 2024 - Present**
  - Working on an AR-driven, Unity-based educational project that leverages LLMs to create dynamic educational narratives and dialogues.
  - Designing and building Multi-Agent LLM architecture to dynamically generate dialogue and adapt educational narrative based on user input and actions.
