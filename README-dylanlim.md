## Past Projects, Experiences, and Awards: 
- Worked as Software Engineer at Stanford Startup where I leveraged multi-threading and parallelization techniques to enhance system performance by up to 8x. Scaled backend to handle object and image recognition; dense video captioning; textual classification; audio enhancement; sparse & dense vector search; integration with content delivery network; live transcription. Throughout this project, became very familiar with Google Cloud Platform, Firestore, Pinecone, Langchain, Docker, and AWS. 

- Worked as a Software Engineer Intern with the American Red Cross, where I acquired expertise in feature selection, developing and fine-tuning machine learning classifiers, engaging in data mining practices, and ensuring the integrity and cleanliness of data for comprehensive analysis. Here, I also lead the development of a chat bot for the main Red Cross website, connecting Red Cross youth volunteers from around the nation.
