# Introduction

Hi! I'm Jailia, a junior majoring in CS with a concentration in HCI. I am very interested in the realm of ethical technology, ranging from product equity and accessibility to the responsible use of representative datasets with complete ownership. While I am relatively new to building software applications, I am excited to learn a lot and make meaningful contributions over the next two quarters.

## Technical Skills and Tools
- Python (and various libraries like Streamlit)
- SQL, MySQL, PL/SQL
- C++
- C
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript, React, React Native, Node
- MongoDB, Supabase

## Previous Projects
My most recent project completed was for CS 147: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design in which I served as one of two main developers on my team. Our final prototype's tech stack included Supabase, React Native, and Node.js. Thus, I have experience with brainstorming, user testing, and rapid prototyping. I also contributed significantly as a designer and product manager, where I made many of the UI/UX decisions, delegated tasks, and coordinated meetings and check-ins to ensure the timely progression of our project. 

## Past Experiences
I was an intern for Siemens on the Grid Software team this past summer. I worked on upkeeping multiple SQL packages responsible for the backend workflows maintaining electrical transformer boxes and grid lines. My tasks consisted of converting Python programs to SQL packages and creating new packages to streamline operations.
