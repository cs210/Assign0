# About me

Hi! My name is Caroline. I'm a current co-term in CS (AI track). I also did my undergrad in CS (designed my own track in Blockchain Tech.) and got a minor in Modern Languages (Portuguese/Spanish). Over this time, I've developed a wide range of technical skills within CS in areas from AI, to Blockchain, to Security etc. 

Some fun facts about me: I'm originally from CT, love running, am an enthusiastic beginner snowboarder, and two of my favorite books are Dune and Shantaram.

## Some past projects
### NL-Driven Generation of Professional-Grade Songs
* Current challenge: there’s not much existing data of songs with human-written descriptions (e.g., “The pop song features a soft female vocal…”)
* So, I created a set of models that generate machine-labeled descriptions given song clips (ultimately to generate synthetic data for the music generation task)
* Next steps still in progress
### "Mug Makeover": Ray-Traced Rendering Generation
* Trained cGAN to generate life-like, ray-traced scenes—seen in state-of-the-art games like Fortnite— given low quality but quick-to-generate rasterized renders
* Collab’d with NVIDIA computer vision researcher
* 4.5x faster than regular ray tracing w/ significant quality improvement vs. rasterized images
### Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange
* Implemented DEX with much of the functionality possessed by exchanges like Uniswap
### Gen AI Research @ Professor Boahen's "Brain's in Silicon" Lab
* Researched if graph neural networks could generate natural language with less compute than transformer-based models

# Other past experiences
* Worked at a consulting firm in Sao Paulo, Brazil last summer on a tech-related project
* Also previously worked at a Blockchain VC in SF analyzing potential investments, supporting portfolio cos. & developing internal investment theses
* Co-founded a 501(c)(3) that works with disadvantaged Portuguese-speaking children in Brazil & Mozambique to connect them to opportuntites
