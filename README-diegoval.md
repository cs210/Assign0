# About Me
​​Hello! My name is Diego and I’m a CS Coterm on the HCI track. I completed my undergrad in CS on the AI track, and I'm interested in blending these together to create intuitive, sleek, user-centered products.

# Technical Skills
* Coursework: CS221, CS224N, CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS147, CS247
* Languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, TypeScript, PHP, HTML/CSS/DOM, SQL
* ML Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, sklearn, scikit-learn, SciPy, Pandas

# Previous Experiences
- **Full-Stack Internships:** Interned at Meta (Trust & Safety) building internal tools for managing and improving detection accuracy among large-data pipelines. Designed a full-stack dashboard with real-time analytics, integrating automated alerts, and built both front-end UX and back-end infrastructure.
- **Research on Microarchitecture Design:** How do architectural parameters affect performance and power consumption? Used ML and explainable AI (XAI) to understand microarchitecture trade-offs at LIRMM in Montpellier, France. Published paper in IEEE Transactions on Computers.
- **Data Analysis for Brain Research:** Developed GSEA-based algorithms for large-scale data to confirm upregulated pathways in brain regions associated with PSP. Published paper in The American Journal of Pathology. 

## Projects

1. **BERT Extensions for NLP (CS224N)**
- Experimented with **regularization (SMART)** and **multitask learning** to boost performance on tasks like sentiment classification and paraphrase detection.

2. **Crop Disease Detection using GANs (CS231N)**
- Combined **GANs** and **CNNs** to expand and evaluate a small dataset of diseased crop images.

3. **Emotion-Aware Music Recommendations (CS229)**
- Built a music recommendation system that integrated recorded emotional states, situational context, and lyrical sentiment for more personalized music recs.
