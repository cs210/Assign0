## Introduction

Hi! I'm Nick Riedman, a senior studying Computer Science on the AI Track with a passion for creating high impact products. I have a strong background in developing iOS applications in the digital health space, from processing user electronic health data with locally executed LLMs in order to automatically generate a medical intake form to automatically connecting to data-generating bluetooth peripherals to collect and manage vitals data for heart failure patients.

Growing up in rural Oregon has inspired my interest in accessible healthcare as well as contributing to projects such as Pest(de)cide, an AI-assisted pesticide selection platform that suggests pesticides that will work safely given a photo of the pest and surrounding area. Working as a team on Pest(de)cide, we placed second in a NYC hackathon. I couldn't be more excited to dive into this project and bring my skills to bear to contribute to its success!
