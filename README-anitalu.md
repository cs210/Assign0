In this game, participants aim to decipher a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, players receive feedback via colored tiles, signifying letter matches or correct positions within the word.</p> |

Triggering a mine by clicking on a cell containing one results in its detonation, leading the user to lose the game.</p>       |
|![](https://anitalu724.github.io/img/projects/skrik.png)|**SKRIK: A SIMULTANEOUSLY AND CO-EDITED CODING WEBSITE** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/jill880829/Skrik) <p>As engineering students, collaboration on coding projects is essential. Our goal is to create an innovative online platform by blending HackMD and Visual Studio Code features. Represented by a simplified version of Edvard Munch's "Skrik" portrait, this platform encompasses three key pages. The login page allows registration via Skrik or GitHub. Upon login, the main page exhibits profile modification on the left and editable projects on the right, along with a creation button for projects and collaborators. Accessing a project leads to the editor page, where the left side manages the file structure, enabling creation, deletion, renaming, and project downloading. The right side hosts the code editor, featuring automatic syntax highlighting, multi-user editing, and displaying users' cursors.</p>|
