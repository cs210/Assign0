Hey! I'm Elizabeth, a senior at Stanford studying Computer Science, with minors in Philosophy and French. I'm interested in how we can use technology for social good, specificially in developping AI that is centered around human values.

In the past, I worked as a full-stack software engineering intern at Amazon and two small YC startups (one was B2B SaaS, the other was B2C). During my internships, I've worked on projects ranging from MLOps to RAG LLMs to React apps. I am also currently doing research at the Stanford Computation and Cognition Lab, investigating whether LLMs are capable of advanced reasoning and metacognition.
