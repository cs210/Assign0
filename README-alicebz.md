## Alice Zhang README
Hi everyone! I'm Alice Zhang, a senior and coterm studying CS with an AI concentration and a Psych minor. I do a lot with **machine learning/deep learning** and **data analytics** with a main interest in **natural language processing**. I have a focus on technical work within the psychological and healthcare fields, but am also widely interested in a variety of NLP implementations and am open to exploration. I was in Jay's CS194W class last year and contributed to the development of an app prototype that helped with medication adherence through a persistent notification system, weekly medication tracking, and optional adherence monitoring with trusted caretakers, and I learned a lot from that class through both a technical and leadership standpoint. I'm very excited for this class and am looking forward to getting to know you all! Feel free to reach out anytime :)
