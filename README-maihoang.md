## 🌱 My Experience

#### Last summer, I was a **AI/ML Research Assistant** @ _VinAI_

where I worked on improving deepfake detection models by augmenting existing state-of-the-art deepfake detection datasets with more deepfakes with in-the-wild conditions (e.g. occlusions, low resolution, side profiles).

#### The summer before my junior year, I was a **Software Engineering Intern** @ _River Valley Irregulars_

where I worked at a startup in a team of just 3 engineers to build a social media platform from the ground up for students at two local universities. Because of the scrappy nature of the company, I got to experience working on every part of the platform!

#### I've also done:

web development for the **Stanford Concert Network**, research with **Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Group**, and data science research with the **World Bank**!

## 🌱 Some Projects

### **Vision Transformers for Robust Satellite Imagery Classification**

- For CS231n: used vision transformers instead of a traditional convolutional neural networks to try to classify satellite images by their land use.

### **Plant Tracker**

- Made this for myself to keep track of my collection of ~30 houseplants because there wasn't an existing app with the features I wanted that was free.
- Equipped with a plant identifier via photo and powered by plant.id API
- Has an interface for me to log the plants I have as well as the last time they were watered and fertilized
- Sends me an email alert when it's time to water each plant again

### **Things With You**

- Similar to the plant tracker, I made this for myself because there wasn't an existing app with all the features I wanted that was free
- Full stack application allowed me and my partner to make a shared bucket lists
- There was an interface for us to add items to the list, mark them done + add photos of us doing the activity
- Included Google OAuth
