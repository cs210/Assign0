## üåü Projects

### üîç **VSR (Lip Reading) for Egyptian Arabic**
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, GCP, FFmpeg  
- I spearheaded the creation of the **first-ever Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) dataset for Egyptian Arabic**, working with a team of 33 volunteers.  
- Developed 7 state-of-the-art VSR models with remarkable accuracy metrics:
  - **Top-1 Accuracy:** 97.44%  
  - **Character Error Rate:** as low as 3.8%  
- This project broke new ground for VSR in low-resource languages, opening doors for advanced accessibility and communication technologies in the region.

## üíº Professional Experience

### üí° **Software Engineer Intern at Valuenex Inc.**
*Jun 2022 ‚Äì Sep 2024 | Palo Alto, CA*  
- Developed a **document categorization algorithm** using computational geometry and hierarchical data mapping.  
  - It became a **core production feature**, adopted by **half of the Fortune 500 companies in Japan**.  
- Designed and built a **Unity 3D game** that landed the company its **largest-ever contract** with Otsuka, a leading pharmaceutical company ($30Bn+ market cap).  
- Created a **GPU-accelerated interface** for projecting 5M+ data points as documents on a spherical surface.  
  - Users could explore immersive 360¬∞ visualizations via VR or mobile devices.  
  - Optimized interaction with **precomputation and boundary-aware caching**, achieving a **250x speedup**.  
- Launched a **mental health app** for clinical trials:
  - Built with MongoDB, RESTful APIs, and React Native.  
  - A/B tested and deployed multiple iterations to maximize user engagement and stress reduction.

### üß† **Stanford NLP Researcher (Prof. Monica Lam & Chris Manning)**  
- **GPT Agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  - Integrated GPT feedback agents into **STORM**, a multi-agent LLM generating comprehensive, cited articles for **30k+ users**.  
  - Built and deployed a **custom RAG pipeline** using Qdrant and Langchain, enabling personalized data retrieval from user-uploaded repositories.  
- **Advancing NLP for Arabic:**  
  - Fine-tuned Google‚Äôs **BERT model** on 2.5M+ Egyptian Arabic sentences, achieving **67.2% F1 score** on unsupervised question answering.  
  - Developed tools for annotating and training Egyptian Arabic NLP models:
    - Improved NER accuracy from **74% to 88.6%** with a Flask annotation app.
