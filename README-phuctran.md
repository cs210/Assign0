I am a senior studying computer science on the computer systems track. 

My personal website is still in the works, but you can check it out [here](https://www.hellophuc.com 'phuc - personal website')! Aside from academics, I enjoy playing tennis, creating art, and playing video games (valorant anyone??). 

## Skills

- **Currently learning**: AWS (through CS40), React.js, React Native

## Experience
### Intel - Engineering Intern (Jun 2022 - Jan 2023)
- Over the course of 7 months, I worked with a team of CPU verification engineers to identify areas of software need within the team. After several discussions, I learned that a very time consuming part of their testing process is parsing through multiple filed error logs.
- To address this issue, I developed a data parsing tool that allowed engineers to query through multiple files at once. The tool also supported several features such as an hierarchical display, and filitering. I also designed a frontend framework to make the tool more user-friendly and acessible.
- The tool is now deployed internally and is used by my team on a regular basis!

### Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Group - Research Assistant (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022)
- My project focused on researching the mirroring and amplification capabilities of GPT-3 by performing semantic analysis (Lexicon 2.0, VADER) on the input and the GPT-3 output.
- To do so, I cleaned several conversational datasets and prompted them into GPT-3 using Pandas, NumPy, and OpenAI's API. 

## Projects
### CS145 Data Exploration - Yelp Dataset
- My teammate and I wanted to explore the success metrics for Yelp. To do so, we converted the JSON dataset into a structured dataset and imported it into Google BigQuery.
- Leveraging Matplotlib for data visualization and SQL, we explored how review semantics, proximity/location, users, and business categories affect the overall success.

### CS144 Network Stack Infrastructure
- Through the various labs, I implemented network stack infrastructure encompassing bytestream management, TCP protocol implementation, network interface functionality, and ARP routing.

### TreeHacks - Lasso 
- lasso is an educational web game designed to make studying more engaging and effective. Using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 prediction language model, lasso turns your notes into a set of review questions, making it easier to prepare for exams and retain important information.

## Fun Facts
- I have worked at a Pho restaurant for four years. During my time there, I worked as a server, dishwasher, kitchen prep, and chef.
- Prior to college, I surveyed my friends for an english name to call myself. I settled on one and then changed my mind mid-quarter. There are still people who know me by this name and they can probably never find my socials now... (Anyway I am workshopping more english names, let me know if I look like a certain name ðŸ˜­)
