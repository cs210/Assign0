I am a Second-Year Master's student at Stanford University specializing in AI and Software Systems. I graduated with a Bachelors' from the Indian Institute of Technology Goa as a Silver Medallist in 2023. I am passionate about the areas of AI and Software Development, specifically the domains of Natural Language Processing, AI-driven Predictive Analytics, Recommendation Systems and Applications of Machine Learning to Domain-Specific Problems. My goal is to build intelligent & autonomous decision-making agents in different domains with a focus on devising efficient and reliable ML systems.

## Technical Skills
C, C++, Python, Java, TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, PySpark, scikit-learn, MATLAB, SQL, AWS, Git.

## Previous Projects
During Summer'24, I was a SDE Intern at Amazon, where I worked on building recommendation systems, especially designing and deploying a new API to serve personalized suggestions by leveraging advanced recommendation algorithms and data retrieval techniques.

Previous: As a ML Researcher at IIT Madras, I worked on LIBS-assisted prognostic Machine Learning for gas insulation systems (Presented at IEEE ICPADM 2021 Conference, Malaysia; published in IEEE Xplore, and in the Journal of Physics Communications, IOP Publishing, UK). I also worked as a RA in the research group of Prof. Dr. Asli Eksi, Salisbury University, US where I utilized several ML techniques to solve problems in the domain of Computational Finance. In my final year, I worked as a ML Research Intern at Siemens Technology, wherein I developed Deep Learning based anomaly detection libraries and formulated efficient algorithms for accurate time-series analysis.
