## About Me
Hello! I'm a Computer Science student passionate about Virtual/Augmented Reality, Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.

## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Swift, C#, C++, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Unity, Blender, TensorFlow, PyTorch, React


## Work Experience

### **Software Engineering Intern, Apple** 
- R&D at Vision Products Group (Apple Vision Pro team), developing for AR and 3D graphics/rendering.  

### **Software Engineering Intern, Immergo Labs**
- Developed and optimized a VR Physical Therapy telehealth platform. 
- Built 3D UI, multiplayer experience rooms, and real-time progress tracking

### **VR Research Intern, Stanford Medical Mixed Reality Group (SMMR)**
- Created personalized experiments and simulations in VR for patients with eye alignment issues
- Used Unity/C#, Unity UxF data mangement, and HP Omnicept eye-tracking/logging capabilities. 

## Projects
### **Generating Spatial Images Using Diffusion-based Monocular Depth Estimation**  
**Technologies**: PyTorch, numpy, Unity
- Combined latent diffusion-based monocular depth estimation with stereo rendering techniques like pixel shifting and DoF blur.  
- Generated stereo images for spatial viewing on AR/VR devices from a single 2D photo.  

### **React.PT - VR Game**  
**Technologies**: Unity, C#, Python, C++  
- Created a cross-platform VR reaction time game to assist PTs in treating patients with motor skill disabilities.  
- Integrated gameplay mechanics using Unity XRI, Photon, and custom 3D assets with Blender/OpenGL.  

### **VR Soccer: Head in the Game**  
**Technologies**: Unity, C#, Blender
- Developed a VR soccer game with head tracking, realistic physics, and adaptive ball spawning. Integrated custom 3D assets, immersive audio, interactions, and live analytics.
