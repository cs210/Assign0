# Hi, I'm Kevin!

I'm a senior/coterm in CS. Mainly come from a design/HCI background. Interested in environment and the arts (music, design).

## Project Experience

- **HCI/Design**: UI/UX Interface Design, Interaction Design, and User Research. Comfortable with Figma and Adobe Creative Suite. Various projects via CS247A/147 include:
  - Depop.AI, an AI-powered extension for online secondhand buyers to more efficiently search oversaturated markets (like Depop)
  - NewsCam, a tool that generates hometown news content for out-of-state voters
  - FoodDex, a food edutainment app that encourages exploration of cultural food through a Pok√©mon-esque collection game.
- **Software Dev**: C++, Python, a little bit of JS, C, Julia. Definitely more interested in/comfortable with design, but can still contribute to coding.
  - Did CURIS, where I coded a real-time music prediction software with Prof. Keith Winstein.
  - Currently a research fellow for Prof. Anna Gryzmala-Busse, where I'm creating a web scraper to study nepotistic professions and universities in Europe.

Thanks for stopping by!
