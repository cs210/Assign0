## Experience

##### Renesas Electronics

Intern: Software Development Engineer (AI/ML)         

- Designed AI-based solutions to identify fraudulent activities in sample order requests on Renesas' E-commerce platform.

- Implemented a data collection pipeline on AWS, using Lambda Functions, triggered by data uploads to an S3 bucket. This process efficiently dispatched API fetch requests to SQS, with the resultant data stored in DocumentDB.

- Conducted data preprocessing, data augmentation, feature engineering, and trained weighted-ensemble ML models for fraud detection, achieving a 95% accuracy post-production.

- Engineered a serverless cloud workflow on AWS, integrating API Gateway and Lambda functions to create a RESTful backend API, effectively managing order request processing.

- Deployed SageMaker endpoints to detect fraudulence for real-time fraud detection in order requests, which prevented 60% financial loss, reduced 50% labor cost, and decreased the overall order request processing time by 50%.


##### NHB: Intelligent Medical Systems

Intern: Software Development Engineer (AI/ML)       

- Fine-tuned an OCR model specifically for invoice image using PaddlePaddle, with an accuracy increase of 15%.

- Implemented interactive bounding boxes using React on invoice images, enabling dragging and resizing adjustments around target area. This process segments the image into smaller sections, based on the bounding boxes' coordinates.

- Developed RESTful APIs using Django for image processing, formatting OCR model outputs, and saving to MySQL databases. Successfully onboarded 4 hospitals to the semi-automatic invoice recognition tool, achieving a 75% reduction in manual invoice input time.


##### Eco-environment Scientific Field Trip and Research of the Rhine River

Research Assistant: Prof. Bernhard Schink

- Conducted water sampling across over 10 cities along the Rhine River in Switzerland, Germany, and France, focusing on chemical composition analysis.
- Presented comparative research on the Rhine and Yangtze Rivers at FHNW.

## Project

##### Concert Sharing and Ticket Selling Website

> React, Express, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, NATS

- Developed a single-page application for concert sharing and ticket selling, featuring sorting, filtering, and dark mode.

- Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, Redux and React Query for state management, and memoization techniques for performance optimization.

- Designed an event-driven microservices backend using Express, MongoDB and Redis, integrated NATS for event bus communication, and incorporated Jest for unit testing and JWT for secure authentication.

- Achieved efficient and scalable deployment on multiple clusters using Docker and Kubernetes.

##### Spatial Temporal Prediction of PM2.5 Using Machine Learning

> Python, Sklearn, Pytorch

- Developed robust machine learning models to predict PM2.5 levels, selecting XGBoost based on superior performance (RMSE 1.9) and computational efficiency.
- Performed feature engineering to incorporate spatial temporal information, enhanced model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning and applied Gaussian filters for noise reduction.
- Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key factors in different tasks, including short-term, long-term prediction.

##### Photo Sharing Website

> React, Spring Cloud, Kafka, Docker

- Engineered a responsive photo-sharing web application utilizing React and Material UI, incorporating features such as customizable photo uploads, commenting capabilities, and friend tagging.

- Implemented microservices with Spring Cloud, managed configurations with the Config Server, and set up loadbalancing through Eureka.

- Utilized Zipkin to monitor distributed services and enhance the system availability.

- Developed message queue services and built a high-throughput log collection platform with Kafka.

##### 3D Model Editing via Text Commands

> Python, Pytorch, NeRf

- Developed a new feature for Instruct-NeRF2NeRF model, enabling iterative modifications and complex instructions in text-guided 3D scene editing.
- Designed an algorithm for dynamic 3D scene editing, involving NeRF-based scene initialization from 2D images, prompt atomization, prompt-driven scene modifications, and iterative re-rendering for continuous scene evolution.

##### Text Classification with Language Models and Graph Structures

> Pytorch, DGL, Azure, AWS

- Proposed a novel approach for text classification by integrating language model embeddings and graph structures.
- Enhanced F1 score by 10% on the Amazon dataset after combining a custom GATBiGRU model with original BERT.
- Conducted analyses comparing traditional frequency embeddings and advanced LLM embeddings in GNN tasks.

##### Autonomous Car Navigation

> C++, ROS, Python

- Adopted Vins-fusion SLAM module with ROS on NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform and Intel RealSense D435i camera.
- Utilized position and depth data from SLAM to build OctoMap and run A* algorithm for route planning.
- Used Gazebo simulation and Python pymavlink to test the autonomous car in a maze and optimized the system.

##### I386 simulator

> C, Linux

- Developed a software simulation of an i386 computer system in C and successfully ran an RPG game on the simulator.

- Implemented the x86 instruction set, cache scheduling algorithms (LRU and FIFO), integrated memory management techniques (segmentation and paging), multi-threading and I/O device management.

- Emulated i386 components, including ALU, memory, serial ports, I/O, interrupts, exceptions, and system calls.
