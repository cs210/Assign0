## About Me
Hi! I'm a Coterm student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus on A.I. For most of my Stanford career, I worked at the Thrun Lab (Stanford A.I. Lab), working on reducing sampling complexities of machine learning algorithms with a focus on statistical models. I also worked on methodologies such as multimodal data augmentation and implicit geometric representations to better enhance machine learning tasks. Previously, I was a course advisor for CS109 and now I'm doing research with Chris Piech and Dan Schwartz.

## Projects

### Sublinear k-medoids
Made algorithmic improvements that lead to 10x speedup on BanditPAM â€“ the SOTA
k-medoids clustering algorithm. Maintained a high-performance Python package, written in C++, that
implements the algorithm. Open source, 600+ stars.

### Faster Forest Training
Developed a 50x faster sublinear node-splitting subroutine that accurately finds split
points for constructing decision trees on both classification and regression tasks.

### Multinomial Augmentation
Generated a 233,000+ parameter augmentation map for Visual Question Answering (VQA) data
augmentations to be learned directly from the data without an exhaustive hyperparameter search
