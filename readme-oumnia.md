Introduction
I am currently a CS coterm on the HCI track. I majored in CS on the AI track for undergrad.

I was a CA for CS109 last quarter, and during my undergrad I RAed a freshman dorm, studied abroad in Florence, and did research here at Stanford and elsewhere.

Recent Projects:

App development: For my senior year project, I built an app called SocialStudy to connect students to other students in their classes. I learned a lot of React Native 
and Firebase in the process.
