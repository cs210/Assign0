Hi, I'm Nathan! I have a blog at [nathanzhao.cc](https://nathanzhao.cc) and a github at [github.com/nathanjzhao](https://github.com/nathanjzhao).

# Technical Background

## Research & Machine Learning
I'm currently interning at the Robotics and Embodied Artificial Intelligence Lab, focusing on diffusion policies. My background in ML includes a previous internship at K-Scale Labs, where I worked on robotics applications.

## Notable Projects

### Interactive MuJoCo Environment with TensorFlow.js
Built a browser-based interactive MuJoCo physics simulation environment that runs ML models directly in the browser using WebAssembly. The project demonstrates the intersection of physics simulation, machine learning, and web technologies.
- **Tech Stack**: MuJoCo, TensorFlow.js, WebAssembly
- **Live Demo**: [Interactive MuJoCo](https://nathanzhao.cc/interactive-mujoco/)

### Anonymous Blogging Platform
Developed a feature-complete anonymous blogging platform in 2 days, incorporating:
- Browser fingerprinting for user identification
- Medium-inspired UI with markdown support
- Full-stack implementation using Next.js and AWS Aurora RDS (PostgreSQL)
- Post management system with threading support for replies

## Technical Skills
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Diffusion Models, Robotics
- **Web Development**: Next.js, Vercel, shadcn/ui, FastAPI, prisma
- **DevOps**: AWS (including Aurora RDS, EC2, other services)
- **Languages**: Proficient in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **System Design**: Full-stack architecture, Database design

I enjoy rapidly prototyping and building complete systems, with a particular focus on the intersection of machine learning and practical applications. My background spans both research-oriented projects in robotics/ML and production-ready web applications.
