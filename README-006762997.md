## Introduction
Hi,
I'm Simon, a PhD student in Applied Physics. I'm originally from Munich, Germany.

Here are some projects I worked on in the past:
- Created a mobile game in Android Studio and publish to Google PlayStore
- Programmed a software + GUI to analyze measurements with a Langumir-probe for an experiment at the ISS
- Programmed an AI agent to play the game hexagon as project for the class Artificial Intelligence at University of Melbourne
- Data Scientist @Subcapitals (FinTech Startup)
  - Anomaly detection for stock time series data using SVM and isolation forest
  - Trading system based on sentiment analysis of over 700 news sources using NLP models like BERT and FinBERT resulting in a financial product which can be bought on the stock market
  - Transformer model to predict the price development of foreign exchange time series data
- Data Scientist @Reonic (ClimateTech Startup)
  - Programmed solar energy and heat pump simulations in RUST
- Research Assistant
  - Trained and tested DNN model for molecular dynamic simulation resulting in a  peer-reviewed publication
- Engineer Trumpf (Semiconductor Industry)
  - Programmed a computer vision software which resulted in an invention and saved the company over 100,000$ annually. 
  - Automatization of statistical process controll for test machines
- Hackathons in SF/AGI House - Highlight: Digital Assistant for people with dementia and Alzheimer's powered by LLMs
- Trained and tested a  fall detection model (DNN, tensorflow) using accelerometer data for CS229 at Stanford University
