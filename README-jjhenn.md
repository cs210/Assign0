# About Me
Hi, I'm JJ Hennessy and I'm a current senior studying CS on the AI track. I'm originally from Chicago and the youngest of 4 children. 

# Technical Skills
I'm most experienced in front-end, but have some experience doing full-stack. My best languages/frameworks are JavaScript (React, AngularJS, TypeScript), Python, and some C/C++. I also have experience training ML models in Python, but am certainly not an expert.

On the team, I would love to do both full-stack development and assist with training and integrating ML models / LLMs as necessary.

# Industry Experiences
Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jj-hennessy-a79634133/) for my previous software engineering experiences. 

During my gap year before entering Stanford, I did both data analytics (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks) and full-stack web app development in AngularJS, TypeScript, and Python for a Series-B FinTech company, Eventus. I returned there for an internship the following summer. 

The next summer, I interned as an AI Engineer at Kind Humanoid, a humanoid robotics startup, to develop an LLM capable of planning actions for their humanoid, Mona. 

This summer, I did a SWE internship at Palantir, where I shipped multiple new features for the frontend security components of our defense and intelligence applications. I will be returning full-time to Palantir in mid-August.
