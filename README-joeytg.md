## Joseph Guman

I am CS student currently pursuing my systems undergrad and artificial intelligence master degrees as a senior. My general interests focus on the tech stack revolving large data analysis and computation.

- Last summer I developed internal tooling within Amazonâ€™s LLM org to automate multimodal ML inference data management, pipelining, evaluation, and visualization. Within a newly developing team, I built the architecture responsible for the automation of ML model running, statistics gathering, and database design and maintenance.
- In my sophomore summer I worked for the Stanford Center for Automated Reasoning. I Developed specialized local search algorithms using Boolean satisfiability techniques to apply automated reasoning frameworks to the domain of robotic planning.
- I also enjoy doing research with my friends Chris Pondoc and Joey O'Brien (and I hope to do a project with them again in 210) with projects like [Recognizing real vs diffusion created images](https://github.com/cpondoc/diffusion-model-analysis), [Developing an RL benchmark on evacuations during a wildfire](https://github.com/sisl/wildfire), and [Exploring word shifts in LLMs](https://github.com/JosephGuman/word-shifts)
