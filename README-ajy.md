# Hey there!

Nice to meet you! I'm Jun, and I'm a senior double majoring in CS and Econ with a minor in Creative Writing. My CS interests include AI alignment, graph ML, algorithm design, cryptography, and LLM prompt engineering. Outside of CS, I'm also interested in financial theory, contemporary poetry, photography, urban planning, and environmental activism. You can reach me at [ajy@stanford.edu](mailto:ajy@stanford.edu).
