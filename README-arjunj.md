## Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Arjun, a senior from Portland, Oregon majoring in CS (AI Track). I decided to take CS210A because I wanted to get hands-on experience with building a software product from scratch and the projects align with my passion for applying technology to tackle real-world problems. 

## My Experience 

I have industry experience in AI and SWE at large companies and startups. My freshman summer, I worked as a "Cloud and AI Intern" at Intel where I worked closely with customers to understand their AI use cases and then built and deployed AI pipelines for these use cases and optimized them on Intel hardware. My sophomore summer, I worked as a Full-Stack SWE intern at Sigma Computing, a Series-D startup with a cloud-based business intelligence platform. At Sigma Computing, I worked across the stack to build a pipeline for exporting Sigma data workbooks to Excel sheets. 

In addition to industry, I have also conducted research at Stanford. My research has primarily focused on the application of AI to the healthcare space. Projects include finetuning a BERT-based model for extraction of diagnosis codes from clinical notes and finetuning a multimodal LLM for identifying underdiagnosed medical conditions from radiology scans and notes. 

## Skills

I would say my strong suit definitely is back-end development, however I am open to taking on front-end development. I also have extensive experience with AI/ML engineering and comfortable with training/finetuning AI models. 

## Languages

Python, Java, C++, C, Rust, TypeScript
