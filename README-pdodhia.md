# Introduction
Hi! I'm Parth, a year 2 MS EE student. I'm excited about applying Machine Learning to real-world problems!

### Technical Skills : ML frameworks (Pytorch Tensorflow), Python, C++, Git

# Past Experience

**Prodigal Tech** 
- Unsupervised Dialogue State Tracking using LLMs for analysis of debt collection calls

**Personalized Integrative Medicine Lab** 
- LLM based information extraction from breast cancer reports

**Samsung Electronics**
- GAN-based image cartoon stylization with scarce training data

**Indian School of Business, Hyderabad**
- Company 10K report analysis using a recurrent network based climate word classifier

# Projects 
**LLM optimizations**: Implemented pruning and simulated 8-bit outlier aware quantization from scratch to optimize GPT2

**Stock Price Forecasting**: Applied statistical (ARIMA, Prophet) and machine learning (XGB, RNNs, Transformers) based methods for short and long horizon stock price forecasting

**Novel Data Augmentation for Image Captioning**: Multi-modal text and image data augmentation for image captioning

**Recommender Systems**: Implemented various traditional, deep learning and ensemble movie recommender systems

**RL for American Options Pricing**: Deep Q-Learning to predict continuation values and price American Options
