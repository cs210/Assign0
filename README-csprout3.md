# ABOUT ME 

## Intro

Hey, I'm Cole! I completed my undergrad here in SymSys along the AI track and I'm currently a CS coterm student on the HCI track. I am passionate about enhancing the human experience through technology while critically examining traditional approaches that aim to achieve this. In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm also a member and captain of the cross country and track teams here at Stanford! Here's some more on my background:

---

## Previous Projects

### Project 1: Extending Unitary Convolutions for Graph Learning (2024)
- **Description:** For our CS224W final project, we extended the NeurIPS 2024 pre-print Unitary Convolutions for Learning on Graphs and Groups by implementing enhanced matrix exponential calculations and regularization to improve robustness and address oversmoothing in graph neural networks.

### Project 2: Flow (2024)
- **Description:** In CS147L, I built an app that connects a user's Strava account through their API to fetch/display relevant progress and performance metrics. 
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, Strava API, React Native, Github
- **Links:** [Demo](https://vimeo.com/1042470044?share=copy) | [Github Repo](https://github.com/csprout3/stanford_projects.git)

### Project 3: Training LMs on Dynamic Text (2023)
- **Description:** In my capstone SymSys project, I wanted to explore the limitations of training LLMs on static datasets to identify areas for improvement. As such, I investigated how curated datasets can enhance the encoding of social intelligence in LLMs by building, training, and validating a DistilBERT model on benchmark 'social reasoning' datasets.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Github, AWS, SocialIQ Dataset

### Project 4: Political Bias and Sentiment Analysis (2022)
- **Description:** In CS224u, my partner and I recreated Saligrama’s KnowBias algorithm and explored improvements by testing updated word embeddings, advanced neural classifiers, and refined tokenization schemes. Through these modifications, we achieved higher accuracy in detecting political bias in tweets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our enhancements over the original model.

## Past Experiences

- **Intern at Magnifi by TIFIN:** I worked alongside their Chief of Brand and VP of Product to streamline their AI-powered chatbot. Specifically, I worked on refining the user experience and general “flow” that a user was taken through when they wanted to design a basic diversified portfolio. The goal was to educate the user while also stripping away any unnecessary financial jargon to make this a simple and accessible flow to an inexperienced investor.

- **Name, Image, and Likeness Brand Deals:** I've collaborated with and created digital content for companies such as Nike, Garmin, On Running, and Stryd.
