# Jack Xiao
Hello! I'm a coterm Master's student in CS (AI concentration). In my undergrad, I double-majored in CS and music.

Talk to me about: film scores, piano, cooking, bartending/mixology, or anything sports related!

## Experience
### Projects
- **Sentence Transformers for Idiom Representation**
    - Evaluated the effectiveness of various loss schemes in fine-tuning a sentence transformer to increase the embedding similarity
between idioms and their definitions, using cosine similarity as metric and t-SNE plots to measure/visualize training effects.
    - A triplet loss scheme with the idiomatic sentence/non-idiomatic paraphrase data yielded a 2.8x increase in average cosine
similarity between the idioms and corresponding definitions while maintaining a lower similarity for incorrect pairs.

- **Gesture-controlled Musical Fruit Ninja**
    - Used OpenCV to implement gesture-control for mouse, for operating within a primitive version of Fruit Ninja created and scripted in Unity.
    - Sound generation and synchronization with Unity game events was implemented using ChucK.

- **LLM-enhanced Social Chatbot**
    - Utilized LLMs to develop an automated framework for evaluating and providing feedback/improved responses on previous chatbot conversations, for the purpose of using results with GPT to update the code of existing stand-alone chatbot.

- **Out-of-domain Land Cover Classification**
    - Using time-series data from MODIS satellite imagery sampled across the globe from areas with ample labeled examples, implemented variations of ConvNets, LSTMs, and Transformers to evaluate their ability to generalize on an out-of-domain test set from areas with limited labeled examples.

- **Mixture-of-Experts for Out-of-domain Questsion Answering** 
    - Trained and fine-tuned a Mixture-of-Experts model with multiple DistilBERT experts on 3 in-domain QA datasets, improving generlizability and performance on unseen out-of-domain test datasets compared to a single baseline DistilBERT model.



### Internships
- **Software Engineer Intern at DoorDash** (2023)
    - Trained a LightGBM classifier on large amounts of delivery data to detect unexpected store closures/periods of high cancellation.
    - Integrated model into DoorDash platform and ran experiment on live orders to confirm improvement in cancellation metrics.
    - Refactored and updated data pipeline to make future re-training of the model easier and more efficient.

- **Machine Learning Intern at Adobe** (2022)
    - Implemented data processing to extract user/template features and calculate embeddings to represent the text data.
    - Utilized deep learning and gradient boosting models to classify/cluster users and templates, improving the recommendation system on Adobe Express.

- **Software Engineer Intern at Amazon** (2021)
    - Designed and implemented an end-to-end prototype of an identity resolution model to increase Alexaâ€™s confidence in
identifying a speaker based on the text content of their speech.
    - Implemented heuristic-based, probabalistic, and deep-learning models to create text profiles, evaluate text similarity and predict a speaker.
