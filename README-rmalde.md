## Internships

Google – Software Engineering Intern JUN 2023 – SEP 2023
- AI applied research for anomaly detection in GCP AppEngine server outages. Ideated and built a transformer-based deep
learning model in TensorFlow to improve existing server outage detection algorithm.
- Improved algorithm coverage from 37% to 70%, and implemented these changes into AppEngine production code in C++

Audioshake – Machine Learning Intern JAN 2021 – APR 2021
- Designed deep learning models in TensorFlow to classify instrument data for source separation. Implemented convolutional
layers using techniques from cutting-edge signal processing & ML research papers, such as SincNet
- Doubled the number of instruments classified in the company’s existed model while maintaining high accuracy, by creating
new training pipeline to aggregate, clean, and augment new datasets

## Projects

Composing Foundation Models for Egocentric Video QA JAN 2022 – MAR 2022
- Formulated a text-based latent space by which foundation models are chained together for high-level tasks such as 1st
-person
Video Q&A. Currently building a visual assistant on AR glasses prototype ([github.com/rmalde/Ego-QA-231](github.com/rmalde/Ego-QA-231))

Meta-Reinforcement Learning in Complex Task Distributions SEP 2022 – DEC 2022
- Created scalable Mujoco world generator for RL task distributions that include navigation and object manipulation
- Implemented and assessed leading Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithms in PyTorch on varying RL task difficulties,
demonstrating differences in models for real-world, complex tasks ([github.com/mhelabd/Meta-RL/](github.com/mhelabd/Meta-RL/))
