# README - Jake Lee

## Introduction
Hey everyone! My name's Jake and I'm currently a senior on the CS AI track. I am interested in the intersection of music and AI, and hope to do something related to that in the future. Before coming to Stanford, I was a classically-trained pianist for 11 years. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkXOrkeZyqQ) is my favorite piano piece played by my favorite pianist :)
