## Introduction
Hi! Im Polys! 
I am a senior doing my BS in CS AI and applying to coterm in systems! I am interested in creating cool meaningful stuff.
## Work Experience
### MLE @ BuildCheck AI
Built object detection software for architectural floor plans and won the NfX Stanford FAST competition
### Frontend Developer @ Bank of Cyprus
Implemented and deployed new features and bug fixes on the front-end of the B2B platform
### Machine Learning Intern @ Wargaming
Predicted with 90% accuracy the number of people clicking on sponsored Wargaming links, and web-scraped user data
### Cyprus Navy
Member of the Cyprus OYK Underwater Demolition Teams


## Projects
### CS251 - Blockchain Technologies
Implemented a decentralized splitwise app and decentralized exchange for a new crypto token
### SNMMI Radiomics Challenge
Developed a regression model using Gaussian Mixture Modelling, data transformations and synthetic data generation to predict patient outcomes given hundreds of radiological features 
### CS231N - Improving Semantic Segmentation Using MAE + ViT
Built and trained a vision transformer model, with masked auto encoding during training, to beat a U-Net baseline for semantic segmentation 
### CS224N - Unifying Different NLP Tasks with A Question-answering Model
Trained a question answering model on top of BERT
### CS230 - Venous Bifurcation detection for Automated IV Insertion
Trained a CNN to identify venous bifurcations in hand pictures, in order to identify optimal IV injection sites for surgical robots
### CS229 - Emergent Ant Colony Behavior with Reinforcement Learning
Used the NEAT algorithm to simulate ant colony behavior

## Languages
Python, C++, C, Verilog, Javascript, Solidity
