Hello! My name is Jonathan Affeld and I am a senior studying Computer Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interaction.

## Prior Experience
### PwC (Cloud and Digital Consultant Intern)
**Problem:** Sensitive data from client (largest oil pipeline in the United States) was compromised by Russian hackers. Additionaly, Hardware and Software asset management practices were outdated.
**Solution and Impact:** Helped integrate industry leading Service Management solution. Performed user research inverviews and initialized open dialogue with client. As a result from the discoveries made in the interviews, I fully automated their Onboarding/Offboarding process, designed and developed a new internal service portal using JavaScript, and utilized python to aggregate and clean company data to load into dashboards for executives. Finally performed user acceptance testing (UAT) on new features.
### SAP (Product Developer Intern)
**Problem:** A large Australian Beer Company contacted SAP for an ERP solution as they struggled to identify stock requirements.
**Solution and Impact:** I conducted requirements gathering and discovered the root of the company's problems was a lack of critical supply chain knowledge. Then, I implemented two solutions: 
1. Designed and prototyped a fully automated Supply Chain AI assistant for lead times optimization. Connected data procured from SAP S4/HANA, cleaned and aggregated the data using python, trained a deep learning regression model on the data, then uploaded the model to SAP IBP. Users would input a product, location pairing (e.g. Voodoo Ranger, Sydney warehouse), quantity, and a need-by date and the program would then output a list of steps and dates for X amount of the product to reach the location by the need-by date. The final program utilized over 4 million data entries with a final error rate of less than one day.
2. Used the cleaned and aggregted data from the first solution to build a three tiered web application for the client to visualize their supply chains. The application used Neo4j as a graphical database, MongoDB as a web server, and React for the front end. Users would select a product, location pairing from a drop down menu and the website would populate with a directed graph of nodes and edges required to complete the product and have it arrive at the location. Bottleneck edges were highlighted in red and users could toggle a button to highlight the shortest path.
### Alvin Ailey (Product Manager)
**Problem:** Covid-19 necessitated an online dancer management tool
**Solution and Impact:** Designed and built on a web-based application, ensuring the framework/libraries are flexible and performs to meet all Alvin Ailey choreographer requirements. For example, if a show was on Friday, only dancers available Friday will appear for a manager to plan the show with. RoleCall App (Dancer Casting Management) digitized rehearsal planning and reduced planning cycle from 2 weeks to 4 hours.
