## Introduction

Hello! I'm Tristan, a masters (coterm) student, studying Computer Science (HCI)! I did my undergrad here at Stanford where I studied CS with a focus in AI and did a minor in MS&E. I'm still here, planning on playing another season for the football team.

Outside of school and sports, I love to be outdoors. I really enjoy hiking, swimming, skiing, and scuba diving. I also love to hunt and fish. After my football career is over I really want to spend sometime camping through the different national parks! I also want to start training for triathlons and maybe even an Ironman!
