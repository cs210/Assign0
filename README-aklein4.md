## Adam Klein

### Introduction

I'm a senior computer science major focussed on AI, particularly reinforcement learning and optimization problems. I like to work on technically difficult and cutting-edge projects.

### Skills
1. Deep Learning
2. Reinforcement Learning
3. AI search methods
4. Combinatorial Optimization

### Experience
 - Reinforcement Learning for Structural Biology
   - Worked on an industry research team to discover the shape of organic moledules using novel physics-informed reinforcement learning methods.
 - Reinforcement Learning for Bin-Packing
   - Applied reinforcement learning in an industry setting to optimize the arrangement of parts in 3d printers. Demonstrated an incrase in printing efficiency compared to classical methods.
 - Polynomial Factorization Research
   - [github.com/aklein4/ArithSearch](github.com/aklein4/ArithSearch)
   - Researched the application of combinatorial optimization methods to the polynomial factorization problem. Showed a reduction in factored size compared to previous works.
 - Inference-Time Optimization for Image Generation
   - [github.com/aklein4/ImageSearch](github.com/aklein4/ImageSearch)
    - Applied search methods to the inference-time parameters of diffusion-based image generators to improve the quality and controllabilty of results.
