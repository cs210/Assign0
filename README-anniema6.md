## Hi! I'm Annie.

I'm a strong frontend and full stack developer. I spend most of my spare time working on software projects and am currently a part-time software engineer at [Gamma](https://gamma.app), an SF-based startup I would describe as the best parts of Canva and Notion synergized.

More about me and my past projects: [http://www.anniema.co/](http://www.anniema.co/)
