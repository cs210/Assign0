## Introduction
My name is Emily Macias and I am a junior studying computer science in the human-computer interaction
track. I am very interested in learning what goes into designing good UI/UX and how to use the
design process to create good solutions for problems! I am still new to building software applciations,
but have some foundational mobile development experience and am very excited to learn more about
building software throughout the class!

Programming Languages That I Know:
- C++ (Proficient)
- C (Proficient)
- Python (Proficient)
- React Native (Intermediate)
- Go (Intermediate)

## My Projects
The project that I am most proud of is my CS147 project (introduction to human-computer interaction)
where my team and I designed and built an app where musicians can upload music and performances
for feedback and can give feedback to other musicians. Our team went through the entire design
process which included conducting interviews, brainstorming needs, creating a low-fi prototype,
conducting user tests, creating a Figma med-fi prototype, and coding the app. I was able to gain 
a lot of experience with frontend development and introductory experience with backend. You can learn
more about keynotes at: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/HarmoniousTies/keynotes/

## Professional Experience

I interned with Uber last summer as a software engineering intern. I interned with the Production 
Engineering team to create a new reminder service to ensure that unneeded traffic shifts are reverted 
on time. This would reduce unnecessary load on services while reducing latency in the call stack.

Utilized Golang, Cadence, and Fx dependency injection.
