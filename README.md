## About Ethan!
Currently, I am a senior studying CS (AI Track). I spend most of my time either training in the pool or cooped up in my room catching up on work. The languages I'm familiar with are Python and C++, though I mostly use Python. Recently, I recently created a League of Legends champion detection model which utilized YOLO. I look forward to working with you these next two quarters!
