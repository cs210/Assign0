#### Hi, I'm Josh
I'm a junior studying CS and looking forward to this quarter! I'm most excited about the ManageXR construction project identifying construction anomalies; it feels like a cool futuristic combination of AR and vision. 

One recent project I'm proud of is making an AI-generated video detector that achieved 92% accuracy on OpenAI's Sora. My friend and I put it together at Treehacks and I ended up learning a ton about image and video models and also explored the startup world a little by raising some money from Pear VC and talking to lots of people. 

I spent last summer interning at Facebook, previously sailed on Stanford at Sea, and play lots of basketball. Excited for the course!
