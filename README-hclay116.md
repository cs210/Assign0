- **tools:** React, React Native, NextJS, Tensorflow, Git, AWS

## Experience
1. **A*Star Bioinformatics Institute Singapore**  
I created a webapp built around a computer vision ML model using React, NextJS, AWS, and Typescript. 

2. **Dropbox**  
I worked on a full-stack project using React and Typescript. 

3. **OXOS Medical (biotech startup)**  
I created multiple computer vision models using Python and Tensorflow. The projects were centered around image segmentation and key point detection for x-ray images. 

## Projects 
1. **CS 147L Final Project**  
We used React Native and Supabase to create an app for collaborative bucketlists. 

2. **CS 238 Final Project**  
We used Q-learning and POMDPs to develop a decision making algorithm for hurricane evacuation protocols.

3. **CS 107E Final Project**  
We created a game called BattleDart (think battleship but with darts) using sensors, a raspberry pi, and C++. 

I also have a [personal website](https://www.hannahgclay.com) deployed on vercel.
