## Intro

Hey all! My name is Pedro and I'm a Senior/Coterm studying HCI. Fun fact: I was actually **born** in the Albert Einstein Hospital in SÃ£o Paulo... what a small world!

## Technical Skills

- My technical skills are mostly focused on Frontend/UI, primarily using **React/React Native**
- I also really love using **Figma** to design websites, apps, or anything else!
- On another note, I have quite some knowledge and experience making video games in **Unity**.
