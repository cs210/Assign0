## About Me

üëãüèæ I'm Leilenah - a co-founder of a B2B SaaS startup called Eave Technologies
and a 2nd year MSCS student (HCI track). I took a break in-between undergrad and
grad school to work as a Software Engineer in industry. My strengths are software
development and software project management, but I also enjoy user reasearch and
UX/UI design (hence the HCI specialization üôÇ). I'm looking forward to building
something awesome with cool people in this class!
