# Hi, I'm Jenny!

Hello! My name is Jenny Kim (she/her) and I'm a senior studying CS on the AI track (also coterming in CS!).

## Technical skills/languages
- Python, C/C++, Matlab, Julia, ROS
- Pytorch, TensorFlow
- Dabbling in JavaScript, React
- Google CoLab, Jupyter Notebook

## Past projects/experience

### Computer Vision/Robotics
- Built a computer vision-based robotic arm pick-and-place system to automate maintenance of a vertical hydroponic arm
- Used a custom dataset, YOLOv8 object detection model, and a 6-DOF robotic arm
- Basically: camera sees plant, computer calculates where the plant is, robot arm grabs plant, robot arm moves plant, repeat!

### Computer Vision/Accessible Gaming
*CS231N class project*
- Created a pipeline between facial expressions/head poses on a webcam and mappings to mouse/keyboard inputs for gaming
- Easy, cheap alternative input option not needing precise hand controls! 
- Tested on MarioKart--had a blast!

### Collision Avoidance/Safety Algorithms
*Space Rendezvous Lab research assistant*
- Tested collision avoidance maneuver algorithms in a [satellite formation-flying mission](https://slab.stanford.edu/projects/visors)
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of collision detection between the two CubeSat system
- Used MATLAB for graphical representation and C++ for running simulations

## Miscellaneous
- Trip Leader for the Stanford Adventure Program (in the Outdoor Center!)
- I love photography (digital and analog) and am an avid movie watcher
