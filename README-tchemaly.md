## Hi!ðŸ‘“ I'm Trishia El Chemaly

I am a Bioengineering PhD Candidate, highly motivated by impact. My research focus is in AR for surgery and HCI. I love organzing and participating in hackathons. Previously, I was the president of Stanford XR where I led several initiatives such as founding [Immerse The Bay](https://immersethebay.stanfordxr.org/), Stanford's leading XR hackathon.
