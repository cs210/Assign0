## Hi!👋🏻 I'm Trishia El Chemaly👓

I am a Bioengineering PhD Candidate, highly motivated by impact. My research focus is in AR for surgery and HCI. I love organizing and participating in hackathons. Previously, I was the president of Stanford XR where I led several initiatives such as founding [Immerse The Bay](https://immersethebay.stanfordxr.org/), Stanford's leading XR hackathon.
