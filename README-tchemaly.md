# Hello, I'm Trishia ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm an engineer, XR developer, and researcher, currently building XR technology that redefines surgery. My skill set spans from research techniques to the development of software and hardware in extended reality, computer vision, and neural engineering. As an interdisciplinary PhD candidate at Stanford, I am fortunate to collaborate with multiple groups including the Surgical Simulation lab, the Incubator for Medical Mixed and Extended Reality at Stanford, the Visualization Lab, the Body Magnetic Resonance Group, and the Salisbury Robotics Lab. 

I am dedicated to scaling access to XR technology and making a meaningful impact globally. I am proudly the co-president of Stanford XR, Stanford Universityâ€™s student organization for extended reality. My team and I work on building a community that encourages engagement, creates access, and supports innovation in the extended reality space. I spearheaded Immerse The Bay, Stanford Universityâ€™s first public XR Hackathon, making it the largest XR hackathon in the Bay Area and one of the 3 largest in the world. I also directed Stanford Universityâ€™s first XR incubator program, to support the next generation of XR innovators by connecting them to our global network of mentors, investors, and industry experts.
