## Hi!üëãüèª I'm Trishia El Chemalyüëì

I am a Bioengineering PhD Candidate, highly motivated by impact. My research focus is in AR for surgery and HCI. I enjoy organizing and participating in hackathons. Previously, I was the president of [Stanford XR](https://www.stanfordxr.org/about) where I led several initiatives such as founding [Immerse The Bay](https://immersethebay.stanfordxr.org/), Stanford's leading XR hackathon.
