# Philip Baillargeon (pabaill)

Hey all! I'm Philip (usually go by Phil), a CS coterm from Detroit, MI, studying HCI and AI (with some STS and ethics/philosophy in there too). Thanks for stopping by! Here's a bit about me:

## Front End and Design Experience

If you're looking for someone to build fun and accessible interfaces, I'm up to the challenge. From improving the accessibility standards of standards management applications in industry to running a full-stack event planning platform for my dorm last spring, I'm confident that I can contribute to an efficient product that everyone can use.

Last quarter, my team and I applied the design thinking process to build **[X-Over](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/ThreadsandTrends/X-Over/), a collaborative platform that empowers users to find meaningful teamwork**. Through this experience, I'm very comfortable in facilitating the needfinding process through interviews, iterating quickly with rapid prototyping, and producing full-stack mobile and web applications.

## Research

Although not directly related to software, my research focuses on ethical participatory practices in user experience design and accessibility in social computing. My most recent project is an analysis of social computing technologies for neurodivergent users. Through this work and other projects, I am committed to interrogating the values that underlie sociotechnical systems and exploring ways we can innovate upon collaborative online structures.

If you're looking to **build something new** _and_ **build something everyone can share**, I'm there!
