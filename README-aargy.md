# Anthony Argyropoulos

## Introduction
Hi! My name is **Anthony Argyropoulos**, and I am a senior studying computer science on the theory track, to be followed by a CS co-term in AI. I look forward to collaborating with you in **CS 210** as we build something that adds value and  we can all be proud of. 

## Technical Background and Experience
It is worth noting some of my technical background and experience as we embark on this journey together.

- **Stanford Math Tournament Tech Team**: Currently working on an application that presents like a dating app, allowing graders to swipe right or left on students' solutions depending on correctness. We are also developing more tools and features, including an AI grader, which will be made open source.

- **106A/B Section Leader**: This work has solidified my understanding of object-oriented programming languages and taught me to communicate technical concepts effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

- **Quantitative Investments Intern**: I developed a machine learning model to predict movements in the Volatility Index (VIX).

- **Startup Experience**: Worked on  customizable web page templates to allow clients to build cutomaizable sites in under 5 minutes. Strongly enhanced my skills in front-end development.

- **Track and Field Athlete**: I throw the hammer for Stanford's varisty track and field team. This highly technical event serves as a daily test of my physical and mental capabilites.

This technical background combined with theory-based education has sharpened my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. I am confident that together, our combined expierence can lead to impressive results in CS 210.
