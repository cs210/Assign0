### A short introduction!

**Hello!**

My name is Miro Swisher and I am a senior at Stanford majoring in CS. Here is a rough list of skills and courses I've practiced these skills in:

- CS106B, CS103, CS107, CS109, CS111, CS161 (Fundamentals of CS, Computer Programming)
- CS123 (Robotics, LLM Integration, ROS2)
- CS124, CS224N (NLP)
- CS221 (Fundamentals of AI Techniques)
- CS229 (Machine Learning)
- CS198 (Teaching Computer Science)
- CS148 (Blender)

As a result of this coursework, I have programmed robot dogs, created 3D audiovisual horror experiences, performed ML analysis on what makes songs popular, and section led for CS106A and CS106B for six quarters!

If you are interested in working with me this quarter, feel free to reach out at:
