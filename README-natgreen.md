## Natalie (natalieg1)
Hey all, I'm Natalie. I'm a senior on the information track and I will be coterming in HCI. I love systems, working with data and building intuitive interfaces!

## Past work experience
I worked at Google last summer optimizing parallel processing in the query engine of a cloud database. 

The summer before that I did DevOps at a startup where I provisioned, updated and 
maintained a bunch of AWS cloud resources.

## Projects
I built a raspberry pi bean-bag-toss game in C/C++ that sensed where the bean bag landed via laser grid intersection. The backboard of the game was lit up by LED lights which corresponded 
to the point value of that area and randomly changed each round. I also built a graphics display that kept track of game points. To improve the usability of the game I ran several rounds 
of testing and improved the game layout based on the feedback. 

I analyzed the NHTSA database using Google Big Query. The main area of my analysis was exploring differences in car crash injury severity between genders. All my query code was written in 
SQL. 

I also have a little bit of frontend experience. During highschool I built a few websites using css/html/javascript. Last year I taught myself a bit of React Native and am happy to get up 
to speed on that to build web/mobile apps.

## Skills
C/C++, Python, SQL, AWS 

A bit of HTML, CSS, Javascript and React Native

Overall Iâ€™m super excited for this class and am looking forward to learning and applying my skills to build an exceptional project!
