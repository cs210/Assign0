## Favorite Classes
- CS 144 (Computer Networking): Building a fully functional TCP throughout the class and making a connection over a relay server during the last lab was super cool and satisfying!
- CS 149 (Parallel Computing): Never thought abou tmaking stuff that fast and how much it matters at scale before taking that class.
- CS 107 (Computer Organization & Systems): I know it is an intro class, but it is the sole reason I got into systems in the first place :) Had so much fun designing that heap allocator.
- CS 249i (The Modern Internet): Aside from all the technical jargon about networks, this class took a practical and empirical approach to the internet and networks around us, Prof. Zakir Durumeric was also a fantastic resource to learn from.
