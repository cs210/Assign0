## Introduction
Hey all, I'm Sophie, a CS senior/coterm on the information/AI tracks! I'm always interested in doing more in the realm of social computing, digital humanities, and NLP, especially when applied to internet trends and subcultures, but am down to learn anything.

## Past Experience

**Software Engineering Intern @ Veritas Technologies**

Developed and implemented an LRU-K based cache to investigate performance gains from alternative caching schemes in data restore operations. Built programs to simulate a variety of real-world access patterns to test the LRU-K cache on, as well as a suite of scripts to generate, process, and construct the data needed for simulation. Further worked to analyze and visualize the results gathered in an effective manner. Placed top three in intern class for presentation of work.

**Digital Humanities Research Intern @ Stanford CESTA**

Scraping, restructuring, and analyzing historical texts in order to assess the development of
and relationships between economic associations in Ancient Greece and Rome.

(I'm also a speech coach at Paly!)

## Projects

**MemReprise (CS147)** 

A React Native app with Spotify integration that encourages users to capture their everyday memories, make new and novel associations with their music, and discover new songs based on these associations.

**Learning to Play Starcraft II (CS238)**

Training a bot to play the classic real-time strategy Starcraft II using the classic SARSA algorithm.

**Demystifying r/kpop**

Interfaced with Reddit and download a collection of every post from the subreddit r/kpop, which was then cleaned and analyzed to form a comprehensive data set. Applied statistical analysis to determine how the presence of various K-Pop group names in titles and post content affected user engagement. Created and deployed an interactive, MERN web application to display
these trends in an interesting and easily accessible way.
