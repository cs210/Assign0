## üöÄ Projects 

### 1. **Real-Time Movement Recognition Based on CoreLink**

<u>*Team lead of AR/VR applications | Advisor: Robert Pahle, senior research scientist, NYU Research Technology*</u>

- Managed a team of four using agile principles and was selected to showcase the project at a recruitment conference, resulting in a 50% increase in application rates for the new semester.

- Used OptiTrack motion capture camera and Motive software to capture motion at 120 FPS.

- Developed a C++ client application to connect with the CoreLink server (a real-time, low-latency network framework), retrieving real-time motion capture data in JSON format and writing the results to ASCII files.

- Created a C# script in Unity to receive, decode, and update 21-bone 3D GameObjects with real-time motion data, and performed load testing at 500-550 kbps.

### 2. **Metastack Platform Development (Baidu Internship)**

- Constructed Metastack using C#, .NET, and Unity, the foundation of the metaverse platform, reducing brand development cycles from 6-12 months to within 1.3 months.

- Designed features like photo sharing, check-in rewards, ad placements, and third-party app redirection for a collaborative IP project on the Metastack platform, achieving 40 million impressions and boosting partner sales.

- Developed features for an IP project, generating 40 million impression

### 3. VR Video Game Development (**NetEase Internship**)

- Collaborated with the art and game design teams to implement game concepts using Unity Engine and C#.

- Designed and developed game effects utilizing the Raycast physics function.

- Enhanced character animations with Inverse Kinematics and optimized performance by 30% through an object pooling system.

- Established VR controller functionality using Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit and OpenXR API for cross-platform

support.

### 4. **Hacking the Gender Stack (Hackathon) - Schr√∂dinger** 

- Developed a chatbox application to validate SMILES notation using Django REST APIs for real-time data retrieval.

- Enabled seamless front-end and back-end communication, earning recognition as "Best Developer Tools."
