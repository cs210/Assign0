# Hi, I'm Galen Topper
## Class of 2025

## Skills
Java, C++, C, Python, TensorFlow, HuggingFace.

## Experiences
Over this past summer, I worked in SWE building a semantic search algorithm to find relevant clauses in a document when doing Q/A.
I integrated this into a general workflow that could scan a longer document and answer questions in a matter of mere seconds. 
This was a huge decrease from a human trial which would take 2+ hours for a human to complete. The program would generate about 95% accuracy on its answers, which was much better than expected for a first time program, and work is still ongoing at the company to increase its efficacy. 

## Projects
- Chatbot Project (CS124) Built a realistic movie selection chatbot which can make recommendations based on previously seen movies and offer lively conversation
- Heap Allocator (CS107) Developed a heap allocator in C which achieved high speeds and memory utilization
- SEC Document Parser (Summer Internship) Built a program that processes SEC documents and cleans them for easier visibility


## Background
I'm originally from the Bay Area. 
I also run on the Stanford cross & track and field team!
