I've taken some classes like  CS361, CS229, CS225, CS238, CS231N, CS221, Math 104. 

## My Projects

I am most proud of my project for CS229 in which my group and I build a ingredient identifier CNN "https://14jordanpy.wixsite.com/personal-website/projects". 
My group and I build many different models in order to test how well each of them performed. We ened up building around 20 models, like Random Forest, XGBoost, and also 
used unsupervised learning techinques to try and develop a new way to look at this problem.

## Professional Experience
I interned last summer at a startup and worked there as a full stack software engineer. 
I have experience in react native, swift, and also working with google
cloud functions, performing both front end and backend work.
