# Collin Jung Introduction
Hello, my name is Collin Jung and I am a Senior studying Computer Science. I am also pursuing my Coterm in Computer Science and plan to graduate with both degrees this Spring 2025. For my undergrad, I am focusing on AI and for my Coterm, I study HCI. I would say currently, my skillset revolves around these two worlds with experience doing AI research on campus and several HCI classes in which I developed games, apps, and websites. Previously, I have interned at Wolfram Research as a Software Engineer Intern and most recently, AWS, where I worked in the EC2 VPC team. This coming Fall, I will be joining as a software engineer at a startup in SF. 

In terms of past projects and experiences, I believe I am well rounded in terms of technical ability and design, and am comfortable with the entire full-stack development cycle. Languages I am most comfortable in are Python and Javascript/Typescript, including React/React Native. Read more about me at [collinjung.space](https://collinjung.space).
