## Technical Projects

- This past summer, I dove deep in data analytics, strategy, and database management as a **Data Science Intern at Stanford GSB**. My work involved analyzing over 11,000 alumni records, using Python and R, and formulating a comprehensive data strategy to deploy an Oracle database for GSB faculty and staff. This project was crucial in understanding and handling large-scale data while maintaining data security and scalability.

- In 2022, I developed a machine learning API leveraging convolutional neural networks to **detect fraudulent activity in a consumer energy app for Tata Power**, a large Indian utility, that has a massive user base of *7 million*. This project was a blend of machine learning and practical application, focusing on enhancing consumer trust and data integrity.

- During the pandemic, I contributed to the **user experience of the Disney+ Hotstar streaming application**, working with the iOS development team on the 'Skip Intro' feature which enhanced viewer engagement and satisfaction when binge-watching original content.

- During my sophomore year, I conceptualized and designed **DAHA (Does Anyone Have A...?), a digital exchange marketplace for university communities.** My role was focused on shaping the product strategy along desiging the UI/UX of the iOS application, employing tools like Figma and Sketch to craft an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## Extracurriculars

- Founded and continue to run an **award-winning social enterprise since 2017 called Fruitfully Yours (FLY)**. This initiative is focused on preventing food waste, fighting food insecurity and protecting the environment by harvesting unwanted fruit from residents' fruit trees that would otherwise go waste and donating it to local food banks and pantries that in turn distribute it to the food insecure. In its 6.5 years, the FLY team has rescued over 90,000 pounds of fruit and impacted nearly 80,000 individuals in the San Gabriel Valley.

- Since the start of my sophomore year, I have been involved with the **Stanford Men's Tennis team**, particulary **pioneering the use of SwingVision AI technology** during NCAA tournaments and play for instant player feedback and match analysis. This role is not just about technology implementation but also about enhancing sports performance and strategy by applying new technologies.
