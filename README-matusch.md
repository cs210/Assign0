# Brendon's README

Hi everyone, I'm Brendon! I'm from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. I look forward to meeting you all!

## My experience

These are some of the projects and companies I've worked on:

### Developer at HYPRLABS on end-to-end learning for autonomous food delivery robots
- Robots have to navigate crowded urban areas; I was focused on road crossings, human interactions, and driving in general
- Other areas of focus: neural network explainability, compute efficiency for onboard hardware, and mapping interfaces

### Intern at NVIDIA on Isaac Gym simulation technology and reinforcement learning
- Developing parallelized, GPU-accelerated 3D robotics simulations intended to be used for reinforcement learning and sim2real applications

### Founding team member of Midjourney research lab, working on natural language experiments
- Developed an interface that provides the ability to explore a text repository like Wikipedia in the style of a map interface, zooming in and out in abstract information space

### Research on unsupervised reinforcement learning at Vector Institute
- Studied and implemented potential exploration objectives for unsupervised reinforcement learning, and statistically evaluated their empirical effectiveness on agent behavior

### Machine learning methods for dark matter detection at SNOLAB
- Independently developed models to distinguish background alpha radiation from potential WIMP dark matter candidates

### Converted a go-kart to a self-driving vehicle
- Modified a go-kart with motorized steering control; collected data and trained machine learning model to identify the position of road lines and steer the vehicle

## Skills/Technologies

I have worked extensively with PyTorch and TensorFlow for machine learning on images, text, and audio, and I have experience developing software in several languages including Python, Java, C++, and Swift. I also enjoy presenting my work and writing.
