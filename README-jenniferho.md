## Introduction
Hi everyone, I'm Jen! I'm a senior/coterm from Orange County, California majoring in CS (systems track) and am interested in building impactful AI-integrated software. I have experience with NLP and full-stack developement. 

## Experience
Amazon Alexa AI: developed a standalone web application that personalizes local event recommendations for users based on their interest and location. Used web scraping, LLMs, AWS services, React, Node.JS, Express.js, Python, and Javascript. 

Research Assistant: developed a pipeline to automatically generate stenoses training data for machine learning pressure drop models. Assesses the hemodynamic performance of branched, fenestrated, and mixed endograft designs. Generated stenoses geometries, lofting, meshing, and flow simulation.

CS 224N: Compared different techniques for adapting BERT to downstream NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, semantic similarity). Implemented and evaluated multiple fine-tuning approaches including full fine-tuning, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), DoRA, and rsLoRA (Rank-stabilized LoRA). Found that rsLoRA performed best for sentiment analysis while full fine-tuning excelled at paraphrase and similarity tasks. For text pair tasks, demonstrated that concatenated sequences with token type embeddings outperformed Siamese architectures.

## Technical Skills
Python, C/C++, React Native, Jacascript/Typescript, AWS, Linux
