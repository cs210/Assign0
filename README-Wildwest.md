# Greetings!

### **Amazing first lecture!**
I can‚Äôt wait to dig into the processes of project ideation and selection. What I am looking to get out of this course is a chance to showcase how far we can take these projects to create impact.

## **What Have I Been Up To at Stanford?**
I‚Äôm the first student to work for **Stanford Land Building and Real Estate (LBRE)**‚Äîthe folks who run the city that is Stanford. Over the past three years, I have gained immense knowledge of the ‚ÄúBuilt‚Äù commercial building environment. This deep dive has led to several successful projects, including:

### üéØ **Key Project: Scheduling for Sustainability**
- Developed a full-stack software platform to control commercial Building Management Systems (BMS) for occupancy-based HVAC control.
- **Target**: Automating room-level HVAC controls for **630 buildings (17M sq ft)**.
- **Impact**: Projected **10‚Äì30% energy savings**.
