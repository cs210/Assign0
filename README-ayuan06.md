#Introduction

Hi, my name is Allen and I am a junior majoring in computer science. 

##Skills

Languages: Proficient in Python, Java, C++, Javascript
Python libraries: pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, matplotlib

I also have experience working in front-end development and using frameworks such as React Native.

###Previous Experiences

Last summer, I worked as an AI Intern at Zoom where my main task was to develop a RAG model. The goal for the model was to automatically provide customer support and troubleshooting help for a better overall customer experience. I also implemented additional screenshot functionality so that users could insert a screenshot of their error instead of describing it in words.

I was also an intern at Thrive Capital and assisted in designing/implementing internal company tools and projects, contributing to UI design as well as deciding on and adding in key features of the tool.
