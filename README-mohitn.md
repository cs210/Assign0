#Hi there! 
##Welcome to my Very Chalant Read Me...

**I'm Nathan and I'm a 5th Year Computer Science Coterm. A lot of my background is healthcare focused as I was initially pre-med when I came to Stanford, but I've been trying to pivot towards tech since my Junior Year. Some of my significant past experiences include:**

1. Amazon Software Engineering Intern -- worked on the Go SDK team for AWS so got a decent amount of backend experience.

2. Stanford's Byers Center for Biodesign -- won extension grant for another "startup" software class for "Motherly," an app geared at postpartum care education and management to reduce maternal mortality in marginalized mothers

3. Cheng Lab in Stanford SOM Otolaryngology Department -- lots of wet lab experience with ear cell regeneration, and also developed some machine learning methods for RNA velocity cell profliferation mapping

4. "Selective Prediction for Unstructured Clincal Data" -- a published paper that outlines a workflow revolving around a selective classifier machine learning model for abstraction of data from electronic medical records

5. Stanford Vision & Learning Lab Parternership in AI-Assisted Care Projects - computer vision healthcare projects under HAI CS department

**I've taken many classes in a wide range of topics, and I hope to gain a large amount of experience in software development and implementation in this class. I hope that gives a brief over of my past experience, but you can always feel free to stalk me on [LinkedIn](httpys://linkedin.com/in/nathanmohit), [Insta](https://instagram.com/nathan.mohit), or in person if that's truly your passion. Additionally, you can always feel free to come up and talk to me about my professional past, my future ambitions, if dinner at Wilbur is even worth it tonight, or even the weather forecast and I'll be sure to help you find the answers you're looking for as well as get to know you (all) more!**

*Thanks for reading to the end of my bio, you're a real one <4.*
